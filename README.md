Welcome! 

** Background Info **

I use data from the GALEX Space Telescope, which surveyed the sky in the near- and far-ultraviolet (NUV:2267, FUV:1516 Angstroms). 
I will refer to FUV-NUV color as the difference in brightness (measured in AB magnitudes) across the filters

** Purpose of the Script ** 

By performing synthetic photometry on blackbody curves which cover the wavelengths in each filter, I can determine
which FUV-NUV values correspond to varying blackbody temperatures. 
What results is a one-to-one function between blackbody temperature and FUV-NUV color. 

** Why is this helpful? **

I study stars that flare, and I would like to know how hot they are in order to estimate their energies. 
Flare emission can impact habitability of planets orbiting flaring stars. 
For the purpose of this script, I assume that flare emission can be thoroughly explained by blackbody emission, as many astronomers do
(although in my research I have found that this assumption is not valid at least 10% of the time)
Having data in two filters allows me to take the difference in flare brightness across filters and determine the temperature of the flare at each point. 
That is, I can study the temperature evolution of flares over time!

** What's the picture? ** 

The picture is the plot of color v. temperature generated by the script.
